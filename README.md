## Disclaimer!

Clone without forking! When you're ready to work on it, make a new branch like so:
`git checkout -b feature/YOUR-NEW-FEATURE`

You are not allowed to push to main; this is intentional to prevent breakage, like it is in the real workforce. Instead, submit a pull request, mark it as "ready for review" when it's done, and have someone else go over it so you guys can merge it to main.

## ‚òùÔ∏è **Pitch**

Sauti Africa empowers small business owners, particularly women, to improve their business and economic opportunities to grow out of poverty. 

You will build a platform to enable these business owners to create listing for items they have for sale. 

## ‚úÖ  **MVP**

1. A small business `owner` can login and see relevant prices in various categories to help them set their own prices.

2. They can also make listing for `items` they want to sell, which will show up to all `users`.

3. They add a new `item` by selecting their market `location` and typing in their item's `name`, `description`, and `price`.

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è **Stretch**

1. A business `owner` can upload their `picture` to their profile.
